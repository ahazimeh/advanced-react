connect function in redux is considered a higher order component

HOC steps:
    write the logic you want to reuse into a component
    create a HOC file and add the HOC scaffold
    move the reusable logic into the HOC
    Pass porps/config/behavior through to child component

when naming a file lower case then we are going to export a function by default
for uppercase it indicates that we are exporting a class

export default connect(null, actions)(requireAuth(CommentBox));
// multi hoc
import {compose} from "ramda"
export default connect(null, actions)(compose(requireAuth, withUser)(CommentBox));
